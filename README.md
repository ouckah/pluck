# Pluck
Pluck is my first attempt at a Swift app, which aims to allow anyone to be a tutor!

The idea is to have an app similar to Fiverr, streamlining the creation of an online business but for tutors. Definitely need to work on my Swift skills but I thought the idea would be cool!

## Apple's Student Swift Challenge
This was a submission for Apple's 2025 Student Swift Challenge. Wanted to make a YouTube video as well as learn Swift, so hit two birds with one stone!

## Run Guide
To run this project yourself locally, clone it to your local machine
```
git clone https://github.com/ouckah/pluck.git
```

Then open **Xcode** (yes, you need an Apple device for this), and either view the previews OR use a simulator.
